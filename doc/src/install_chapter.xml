    <title>General information</title>

    <p>The two main interfaces for running tests with Common Test 
    are an executable Bourne shell script named <c>run_test</c> and an
    erlang module named <c>ct</c>. The shell script will work on Unix/Linux
    (and Linux-like environments such as Cygwin on Windows) and the
    <c>ct</c> interface functions can be called from the Erlang shell
    (or from any Erlang function) on any supported platform.</p>
    
    <p>The Common Test application is installed with the Erlang/OTP
    system and no explicit installation is required to start using
    Common Test by means of the interface functions in the <c>ct</c>
    module. If you wish to use <c>run_test</c>, however, this script
    needs to be generated first, according to the instructions below.</p>
    </section>

  <section>
    <title>Unix/Linux</title>

    <p>Go to the <c><![CDATA[common_test-<vsn>]]></c> directory, located
    among the other OTP applications (under the OTP lib directory). Here you
    execute the <c>install.sh</c> script with argument <c>local</c>:</p>

    <p><c> 
    $ ./install.sh local 
    </c></p>    
    
    <p>This generates the executable <c>run_test</c> script in the 
    <c><![CDATA[common_test-<vsn>/priv/bin]]></c> directory. The script
    will include absolute paths to the Common Test and Test Server
    application directories, so it's possible to copy or move the script to
    a different location on the file system, if desired, without having to
    update it. It's of course possible to leave the script under the
    <c>priv/bin</c> directory and update the PATH variable accordingly (or
    create a link or alias to it).</p>

    <p>If you, for any reason, have copied Common Test and Test Server 
    to a different location than the default OTP lib directory, you can
    generate a <c>run_test</c> script with a different top level directory, 
    simply by specifying the directory, instead of <c>local</c>, when running
    <c>install.sh</c>. Example:</p>

    <p><c> 
    $ install.sh /usr/local/test_tools
    </c></p>

    <p>Note that the <c><![CDATA[common_test-<vsn>]]></c> and
    <c><![CDATA[test_server-<vsn>]]></c> directories must be located under the
    same top directory. Note also that the install script does not copy files 
    or update environment variables. It only generates the <c>run_test</c> 
    script.</p> 
    
    <p>Whenever you install a new version of Erlang/OTP, the <c>run_test</c>
    script needs to be regenerated, or updated manually with new directory names
    (new version numbers), for it to "see" the latest Common Test and Test Server
    versions.</p>

    <p>For more information on the <c>run_test</c> script and the <c>ct</c>
    module, please see the reference manual.</p>

  <section>
    <title>Windows</title>

    <p>On Windows it is very convenient to use Cygwin (<c>www.cygwin.com</c>)
    for running Common Test and Erlang, since it enables you to use the
    <c>run_test</c> script for starting Common Test. If you are a Cygwin
    user, simply follow the instructions above for generating the <c>run_test</c>
    script.</p>

    <p>If you do not use Cygwin, you have to rely on the API functions
    in the <c>ct</c> module (instead of <c>run_test</c>) for running
    Common Test as described initially in this chapter.</p>

    <p>If you, for any reason, have chosen to store Common Test and Test Server 
    in a different location than the default OTP lib directory, make 
    sure the <c>ebin</c> directories of these applications are included 
    in the Erlang code server path (so the application modules can be loaded).</p>
